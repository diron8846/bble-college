   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-NOQwGizF.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-DvQPJsLl.css

   - Folder: "/ (root)"

### Step 4: Wait and Check
- GitHub Pages takes 5-10 minutes to update
- Your site will be at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/hope-for-life-bible-college`

## âœ… What's Fixed

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If you still see a blank page:

3. Wait 10 minutes for GitHub Pages to process
